# GUI-Server-and-client-
Using javaFx, the program allows me to start a server and have as many clients the user desires. 
The clients are also able to communicate through the server.
The server also keeps track of the messages sent between the clients as well as who joins and leaves the server
The clients are able to private message eachother if they choose to (with the exception that the server can still see all messages)
